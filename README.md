**Implementation from Udemy course [Blockchain A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/)**

1) **Blockchain**: simple blockchain implementation
    * Requirements: Postman, Flask==0.12.2
    * Use Postman to interact with the api
    
2) **Coin**: create a cryptocurrency on the blockchain
    * Requirements: Postman, Flask==0.12.2, requests==2.18.4
    * Run all nodes and connect them in Postman with connect_node
    * Use Postman to interact with the api
    
3) **Smart Contract**: ICO for a Ethereum token using a Solidity based Smart Contract
    * Requirements: Ganache, MyEtherWallet (download repo for offline use), Remix - Ethereum IDE
    * Start a Ganache Ethereum blockchain
    * Create new custon network / node in the offline MyEtherWallet instance (values from Ganache)
    * Add and deploy contract with its bytecode from Remix (only 'object' value)
    * Interact with the contract (get Contract Address from Ganache block and ABI from Remix)
